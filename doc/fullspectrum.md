# Replacing the electronics

Full Spectrum claims to have a electronics/software combo in which they have spent thousands of man-hour to develop. What a waste of time. It is not open source, not working in Mac OS or Linux. It's useless for me and many other people.

I got an Arduino Mega 2560 with Ramps 1.4a board and installed GRBL 1.1. I am using Laserweb4 to control it.
